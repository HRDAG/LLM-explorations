[gpt-extraction](gpt-extraction)

Originally started in our [aclu_training](https://github.com/HRDAG/aclu-training) repo, this series starts with a simple [joke demo](gpt-extraction/note/joke-demo.ipynb) and goes on to demonstrate using LLMs such as GPT to extract structured data from document collections.

Follow along with the main notebook at [gpt-extraction/note/justification.ipynb](gpt-extraction/note/justification.ipynb) where we explore using GPT to extract the reason for the DPA finding from the investigation notes.
