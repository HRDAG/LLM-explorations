# Backstory
In the last 30 years, allegations of police misconduct have been investigated by one of two agencies, depending on when the allegation was received and opened for investigation:
- the Office of Citizen Complaints, or the "OCC" for short.
- the Department of Police Accountability, or the "DPA" for short.
Each month, the agency publishes a report that includes their findings related to each investigation.
